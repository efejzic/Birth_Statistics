## North Carolina State Center Birth Statistics Case Study

**Introduction**

This case study analysis will focus on a random sample of 50 births from the available 800 records within the North Caroline Birth Registry dataset.

**Objectives** 

The objective of this analysis is to understand the concept of sampling distributions, compute and interpret confidence intervals for population parameters such as the population mean or proportion and calculate the difference between two sample measures. Using R for this analysis, I will calculate the probability (percentage) for variables sex and smoke and the difference in the proportion (percentage) of low-birth-weight babies between married and non-married mothers. Additionally, I will calculate mean age and weight as well as the difference between the continuous qualitative (gained, tgrams) and qualitative categorical variables (marital, low).
