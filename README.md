## North Carolina State Center Birth Statistics Case Study

**Introduction**

This case study analysis will focus on a random sample of 50 births from the available 800 records within the North Caroline Birth Registry dataset.

**Objectives** 

The objective of this analysis is to understand the concept of sampling distributions, compute and interpret confidence intervals for population parameters such as the population mean or proportion and calculate the difference between two sample measures. Using R for this analysis, I will calculate the probability (percentage) for variables sex and smoke and the difference in the proportion (percentage) of low-birth-weight babies between married and non-married mothers. Additionally, I will calculate mean age and weight as well as the difference between the continuous qualitative (gained, tgrams) and qualitative categorical variables (marital, low).

**Data Description of Variables**

**Note:** MAGE is a discrete quantitative variable. GAINED and TGRAMS are continuous quantitative variables. SEX, SMOKE, MARITAL and LOW are qualitative categorical value with numerical values (0, 1 OR 2).

**Data**

The data below represents a simple random sample (SRS) of 50 records from the available 800 within the North Carolina Birth Registry dataset NCBIRTH800. 95 percent confidence intervals will be calculated for the file name: **LDS_C02_NCBIRTH800**

**Results and Discussion**

Using a simple random sample (SRS) of 50, calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for: 

**a)	the proportion (percentage) of male children**

**b)	the mean age of a mother giving birth**

**c)	the mean weight gained during pregnancy** 

**d)	the proportion (percentage) of mothers admitting to smoking during pregnancy**

**e)	the difference in the average weight gained between smoking and nonsmoking mothers**

**f)	the difference in the average birth weight in grams between married and nonmarried mothers**

**g)	the difference in the proportion (percentage) of low-birth-weight babies between married and nonmarried mothers**
